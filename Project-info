# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Think5 is an **AI-powered human intelligence platform** that sources, vets, and deploys elite experts to train the world's most advanced AI systems. We are NOT a staffing agency. We are a technology company building the infrastructure layer that transforms human expertise into high-quality AI training data.

# SECTION 1: WHO WE ARE

## What We Are

**Think5 is an AI-powered human intelligence platform.**

We sit at the intersection of:
- **AI Infrastructure** — Building the pipelines that convert human expertise into model-ready data
- **Expert Networks** — Curating and managing elite subject-matter experts across every domain
- **Recruitment Technology** — Using AI to identify, vet, and qualify talent at unprecedented scale

## What We Are NOT

| ❌ We Are NOT | ✅ We Are |
|---------------|-----------|
| A staffing agency | A technology platform |
| A temp firm | An AI infrastructure company |
| A recruiting firm | An expert intelligence network |

## The One-Liner

> "Think5 transforms human intelligence into AI training data — sourcing, vetting, and deploying elite experts to build the world's most capable AI systems."

## The Elevator Pitch

Every breakthrough in AI is a story of human ingenuity. Behind ChatGPT, Claude, and every frontier model are thousands of experts providing the feedback, annotations, and evaluations that make these systems intelligent.

Think5 is the platform that finds these experts. Our AI recruiting engine identifies and vets the world's top minds — PhDs, engineers, doctors, lawyers, and domain specialists — then deploys them to train AI models at the frontier labs and enterprises that are shaping the future.

We don't just connect talent with companies. We own the entire workflow: sourcing, AI-powered vetting, onboarding, quality assurance, performance management, and global payroll. We're building the human intelligence infrastructure that AGI depends on.
